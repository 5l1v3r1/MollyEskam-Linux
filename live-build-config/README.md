***SPECIAL ANNOUCEMENT***
I have build my custom live Linux image and installer and called that distro "Molly Eskam Linux v1.0"
What this Operating System does is pretty much like any other debian linux distros except it makes a webserver with a clone of the mollyeskam.net website.
In fact installing this will transform your computer into a website that can be published on the internet.
This OS is based on a xfce4 Kali Linux image. To install it you will need to burn the iso file into a usb stick. For doing so, we recommend bachelor-Etcher program that will help you with this step.

After installing you will need to execute the Updater file that is on the desktop, when this is done you will have a full Kali Linux installation with the mollyeskam.net website hosted on your computer ready to be hosting the webpage on the internet.

Features include the following:
VLC Media Player, Bittorrent Downloader (Deluge), Webserver (Apache2 with SSL), Security tools (from kali-linux-nethunter), File Cleaner (Bleachbit), [Browsers]: FireFox, Chromium, [Image Editor] G.I.M.P2 , LibreOffice, firewall-applet, X11VNC Server and OpenVPN.


Image will be available in few hours at this address:
